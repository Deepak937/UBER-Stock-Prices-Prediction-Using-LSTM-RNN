Project Title: UBER Stock Prices Prediction Using LSTM + RNN with CNN Architecture and TensorFlow

Introduction:

The "UBER Stock Prices Prediction" project is a deep learning application that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architecture to predict the future stock prices of the UBER ride-sharing company. This project aims to leverage TensorFlow to build a robust model capable of forecasting UBER stock prices based on historical data and external factors.

Project Goals:

Develop a hybrid deep learning model combining LSTM, RNN, and CNN to predict UBER stock prices.
Utilize historical stock price data and external factors (e.g., market trends, news sentiment) as input features.
Achieve accurate short-term and long-term stock price predictions.
Provide a user-friendly interface for users to input parameters and receive stock price predictions.
Explore techniques for feature engineering and model interpretability.

Technology Stack:

TensorFlow: Deep learning framework for model development.
Python: Programming language for implementation.
LSTM and RNN: Recurrent neural network architectures for time series data.
CNN Architecture: Utilize convolutional neural networks for feature extraction.
